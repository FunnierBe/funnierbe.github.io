# 100 Days of the DISCIPLINE of of continuously learning about learning

In some sense, this deep dive is about the particular topic of [*ab initio* quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) and how that background might help us do [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) or, perhaps, how we might optimize [**Physics-informed** neural networks (PINN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/theory/phys_informed.html) to be more efficient in searching for or identifying compounds with properties we desire.

THIS is a serious topic.  It is serious because ***the people who choose to do THIS do IT because doing IT is what they DO. Doing THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***
# 100 Days of learning about executable graph compute workflows ... to use *ab initio* quantum chemistry methods

It's 100 Days of learning about everything we need to do make executable graph computing happen.

In order to do this *practically* ... we will apply our Physics-informed machine learning approaches to the realm of *ab initio* or "from first principles" quantum chemistry computation and/or physics-informed neural networks (PINN).

In some sense, this deep dive might seem like it's about chemistry ... the particular topic of [*ab initio* quantum physical chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods) ... but that theoretical background is only important because of how it might help us do [computational chemistry methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry) ... maybe, our approach might be more data science driven, but even then the physical chemistry background still helps us optimize [**Physics-informed** neural networks (PINN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/user_guide/theory/phys_informed.html) ... but even THAT misses the point ... this deep dive is fundamentally about the SOCIAL or collaborative aspect of science.  In order to be more efficient in searching for or identifying compounds with properties we desire, it's MOST important to do this WITH OTHER COLLABORATORS ... with the larger scientific community -- but it's not about some nebulous view of community ... what IS *community* after all.  

This is REAL ... about REAL science and *real science about the REAL specific human beings who share some common values ... it's about REAL human beings and the entire thrust of REAL LIVES which are primarily about being engaged in this quest for practical scientific knowledge.*  People who do this probably do not do it in order to be able to afford nice gadgets or a comfortable home ... ***people who do THIS do IT because IT is what they do and THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***

In the end ... it's mostly about the ***discipline*** of continuously learning about learning and it is this DISCIPLINE which makes this THIS is a serious, consequential topic.  It matters to the individuals, to the REAL scientists doing it. It is serious because ***the people who choose to do THIS do IT because doing IT is what they DO. Doing THIS is what they hope defines or actualizes their existence.***
