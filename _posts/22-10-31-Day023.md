# 100 Days of learning about graph compute -- Day 13

Optimizing, optimizing, optimizing

[Kernel profiling](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute), tracing and detailed performance monitoring are the kinds of things which one does not need to master UNTIL the time comes, but it is necessary at the start to have a modicum of awareness of how these tools might help refine developments or how optimization might be achieved. As we moved to [possibly underpowered] edge platforms, this kind of competency becomes more valuable or likely essential.
