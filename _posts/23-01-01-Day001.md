# We are slow learners

Stop pretending that you did not have it coming ... 

Sure, *sometimes*, maybe the first DOYNK kills someone ... but if you are reading this, we can be kind of certain that you sorta knew that you did not really learn that you should be more careful the first time it happened, or the second time, or the third time ... you just kept at'r or maybe blamed your missteps on somebody or something else.

Then, you really got doynked good and hard ... but will you learn NOW?

Nah ... probably not ... it takes about 10,000 repitions of INTENTIIONED, MINDFUL repitition of the perfect rep to get it down.

## Are you going to PAY ATTENTION now? For the next 10,000 times?
