# Hormesis Is The Reason For Not Avoiding Uncomfortable Shit

It's worth taking some time to understand [WHY hormesis works as it does](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30248927/) ... and exploring [the connections in the larger knowledge-graph of hormesis](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/deb833c50edf205202ed009dbe13ef76b218ec89/Hormesis%3A-Path-and-Progression-to-Significance/graph) certainly will not kill you.

If you ever bother to get cold-adapted ... actually understand the principles and practice Tummo meditation ... work on mastering breathwork and Lojong mind control ... and just generally find ***practical, zero-cost*** ways to PRACTICE using your mind and neurophysiology enhance your immune system |use (https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/episode-44-using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system-huberman-lab/)... ***you will LIVE a LOT better.***

If you get cold-adapted, you will understand why most comfort-seeking people never get to really LIVE ... or experience the feeling of being ALIVE ... but they ***will*** get to SUFFER longer, they ***will*** get sick more and they will certainly complain a heck of lot more ... to some extent, their complaints have merit, ie they are not really **alive***.

The way to make your life worse in the cold is to actually trust and grow DEPENDENT UPON your furnace ... HVAC systems prove that there's no problem so bad that humans can't find expensive, complicated, constantly nagging things that make the problem a lot worse.
