It is not one bit funny.

# Your stairs are trying to kill you.

Well, it's not just your stairs ... pretty much ever last thing in the world can be used as a weapon ... even little viral particles, diseases ... you are constantly under attack from things and you don't even realize it.

Your immune system is actually pretty decent ... it is protecting you from all kinds of stupid shit that you are doing ... but your immune system is not perfect; in fact, it has weaknesses that you could correct, but you are not going to do that because you are so stupid that you STILL believe that you are entitled to a strong immune system.

You are vulnerable, because you have not bothered to make yourself more PRACTICALLY unvulnerable ... the PRACTICAL side of this matters because the Chinese OR aliens OR agents from your government are not going to bother with your idiotic ass ... you do not have to worry about the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor ... OR the Chinese coming into North Korea ... The PROBLEM is with YOU.

### YOUR stairs are trying to kill YOU.

Of course, we know it's not the stairs fault ... it's YOU ... and you generally not really paying attention OR you not having the proper perspective or taking the time to think about the BIG PICTURE.

The PROBLEM is with YOU.

Build the discipline with EVERY step that you take to pay attention to every step.
